Agriculture is the backbone of many economies, and predicting crop yields accurately is of paramount importance for sustainable agricultural practices and food security. Traditional methods of crop yield estimation often rely on historical data and manual calculations, which are time-consuming and prone to errors. With the advancements in data science and machine learning, it is now possible to leverage historical and real-time agricultural data to develop predictive models for crop yield estimation.

The objective of this project is to build a crop yield prediction model that can provide accurate estimates of crop yields based on various factors that influence agricultural productivity. By analyzing historical data and incorporating relevant environmental and agricultural features, the model aims to forecast crop yields for a specific region. This information can assist farmers in making informed decisions regarding crop selection, resource allocation, and planning for optimal yields.
